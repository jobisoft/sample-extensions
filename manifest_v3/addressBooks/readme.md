## Address Books

This extension uses the `addressbooks`, `contacts`, and `mailingLists` APIs being implemented in [bug 1469238](https://bugzil.la/1469238) and its dependencies.

*Warning:* you should not run this extension in a Thunderbird profile you care about. There is a chance it could mess up your address books, eat all your RAM, and scare your cat.
