## Theme Experiment

This add-on includes a `theme_experiment` definition for a new CSS variable `--write-button-border-color` and maps that to the theme color property `exp_write_button_border`, which can be used by the theme API.

The new CSS variable itself is defined by an included CSS file.

### Required changes for manifest v3

No code changes needed.
