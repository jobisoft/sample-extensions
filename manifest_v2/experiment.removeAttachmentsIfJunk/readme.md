## Remove Attachments If Junk Experiment

This extension uses an Experiment to remove attachments from the message display area, if the message is classified as junk.

In order to manipulate the message display area of already open messages and all messages which are opened in the future, the example uses the WebExtension `tabs` and `messageDisplay` APIs.
