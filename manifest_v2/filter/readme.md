## Filter

This extension uses the `mailTabs`, and `messages` APIs being implemented in [bug 1499617](https://bugzil.la/1499617), [bug 1488176](https://bugzil.la/1488176), and the `menus` API to add a *Filter* context menu to the message list which can set certain quickfilter settings.

These APIs are in an early stage of development, and this could break at any time. It also ideally would  appear on the context menu instead of as a toolbar drop-down, but that functionality doesn't exist yet.
