## Experiment API

This extension shows how to write an Experiment API including a function and an
event. It also shows how to listen to custom events.

For more information, check out the [documentation](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/experiments.html).

The Experiment registers a click event handler for the secondary mouse button on
the main toolbar and shows an alert box, if triggered.
